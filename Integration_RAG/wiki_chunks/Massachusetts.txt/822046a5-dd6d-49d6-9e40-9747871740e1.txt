John Adams, 2nd President of the United States (1797–1801)
The Battles of Lexington and Concord, fought in Massachusetts in 1775, initiated the American Revolutionary War.[101] George Washington, later the first president of the future country, took over what would become the Continental Army after the battle. His first victory was the siege of Boston in the winter of 1775–76, after which the British were forced to evacuate the city.[102] The event is still celebrated in Suffolk County only every March 17 as Evacuation Day.[103]

On the coast, Salem became a center for privateering. Although the documentation is incomplete, about 1,700 letters of marque, issued on a per-voyage basis, were granted during the American Revolution. Nearly 800 vessels were commissioned as privateers, which were credited with capturing or destroying about 600 British ships.[104]
