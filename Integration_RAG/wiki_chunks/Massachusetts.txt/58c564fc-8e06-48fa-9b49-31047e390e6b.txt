Pre-colonization
Massachusetts was originally inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family, including Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett.[74][75] While cultivation of crops like squash and corn were an important part of their diet, the people of these tribes hunted, fished, and searched the forest for most of their food.[74] Villagers lived in lodges called wigwams as well as longhouses.[75] Tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems.[76]
