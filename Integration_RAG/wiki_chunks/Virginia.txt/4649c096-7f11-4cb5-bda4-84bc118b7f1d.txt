White-tailed deer, one of 75 mammal species found in Virginia, rebounded from an estimated population of as few as 25,000 in the 1930s to over one million by the 2010s.[140][141] Native carnivorans include black bears, who have a population of around five to six thousand in the state,[142] as well as bobcats, coyotes, both gray and red foxes, raccoons, weasels and skunks. Rodents include groundhogs, nutria, beavers, both gray squirrels and fox squirrels, chipmunks, and Allegheny woodrats, while the seventeen bat species include brown bats and the Virginia big-eared bat, the state mammal.[143][141] The Virginia opossum is also the only marsupial native to the United States and Canada,[144] and the native Appalachian cottontail was recognized in 1992 as a distinct species of rabbit, one of three found in the state.[145] Whales, dolphins, and porpoises have also been recorded in Virginia's coastal waters, with bottlenose dolphins being the most frequent aquatic mammals.[141]
