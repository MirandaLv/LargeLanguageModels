Virginia has around 35–45 days with thunderstorms annually, and storms are common in the late afternoon and evenings between April and September.[118] These months are also the most common for tornadoes,[119] eight of which touched down in the Commonwealth in 2023.[120] Hurricanes and tropical storms can occur from August to October, and though they typically impact coastal regions, the deadliest natural disaster in Virginia was Hurricane Camille, which killed over 150 people mainly in inland Nelson County in 1969.[117][121] Between December and March, cold-air damming caused by the Appalachian Mountains can lead to significant snowfalls across the state, such as the January 2016 blizzard, which created the state's highest recorded one-day snowfall of 36.6 inches (93 cm) near Bluemont.[122][123] On average, cities in Virginia can receive between 5.8–12.3 inches (15–31 cm) of snow annually, but recent winters have seen below-average snowfalls, and much of Virginia failed to register any measurable snow during the 2022–2023 winter season.[124][125]
