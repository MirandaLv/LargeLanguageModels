The Virginia Seismic Zone has not had a history of regular earthquake activity. Earthquakes are rarely above 4.5 in magnitude, because Virginia is located away from the edges of the North American Plate. The Commonwealth's largest earthquake in at least a century, at a magnitude of 5.8, struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011, near Mineral.[106] Due to the area's geologic properties, this earthquake was felt from Northern Florida to Southern Ontario.[107] 35 million years ago, a bolide impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting Chesapeake Bay impact crater may explain what earthquakes and subsidence the region does experience.[108] A meteor impact is also theorized as the source of Lake Drummond, the largest of the two natural lakes in the state.[109]

The Commonwealth's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 limestone caves, ten of which are open for tourism, including the popular Luray Caverns and Skyline Caverns.[110] Virginia's iconic Natural Bridge is also the remaining roof of a collapsed limestone cave.[111] Coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions at 45 distinct coal beds near Mesozoic basins.[112] More than 72 million tons of other non-fuel resources, such
